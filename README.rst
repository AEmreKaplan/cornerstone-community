Cornerstone Community Repository

Aim:
    Create a repository where community members can:
        - Contribute to a public library of components for the benefit of other users
        - Hold discussions over improvements on the designs, or alternative methodologies
        - Form a library of elements that have accessible metadata for easy integration into custom codes

Licenses:
    Three licenses?
        Software / Hardware / Documentation
            Software - This part would be related to the GDSes - TAPR OHL 
            Hardware - Manufactured chips, again TAPR OHL
            Documentation - YAML files or jsons. Can create my own format but seems better to use openEPDA?
                However it would require its own license (CC-BY-SA I think)
                See https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/10320/using-different-licenses-for-different-branches-of-the-same-repository
            OSHWA - would be nice to get verification from them? Feels like they are more involved with electronics/ Maker community, though.
